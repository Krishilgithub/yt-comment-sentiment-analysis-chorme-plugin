# Security Best Practices Documentation

## AWS Credentials Security Issue - RESOLVED âœ…

This repository previously contained hardcoded AWS credentials in Jupyter notebook files. This has been completely resolved through the following actions:

### What happened:

- AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key were hardcoded in multiple notebook files
- GitHub's push protection correctly identified and blocked the push
- Git history has been rewritten to completely remove the exposed credentials

### Actions taken:

1. âœ… **Removed all hardcoded credentials** from all notebook files
2. âœ… **Rewrote git history** to completely eliminate credentials from version control
3. âœ… **Enhanced .gitignore** to prevent future credential leaks
4. âœ… **Created environment configuration system** for secure credential management
5. âœ… **Added .env.example** template for proper setup

### Security measures now in place:

- Environment variables are used for all sensitive configuration
- .env files are ignored by git to prevent accidental commits
- Helper module (`src/config/environment.py`) for secure credential loading
- Documentation and examples for proper credential management

### Required actions for developers:

#### ðŸš¨ URGENT - If you were using the exposed credentials:

1. **Immediately rotate the AWS credentials** in your AWS Console
2. Create new Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
3. Delete the old credentials to prevent unauthorized access

#### For development setup:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in your actual AWS credentials in the `.env` file
3. Never commit the `.env` file to version control

#### In notebooks, use:

```python
from src.config.environment import setup_environment, get_aws_config

# Load environment variables securely
setup_environment()

# Get AWS configuration
aws_config = get_aws_config()

# Use the configuration
os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] = aws_config['aws_access_key_id']
os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] = aws_config['aws_secret_access_key']
```

### Prevention measures:

- Regular security audits of code before commits
- Use of pre-commit hooks to scan for credentials
- Environment-based configuration for all sensitive data
- Never hardcode credentials in code files
